**Hi there! ðŸ‘‹**





ðŸš€ I am a **Full Stack Developer**, passionate about helping people and problem-solving. My recent transition to tech has made me obsessed with the idea of using software to solve practival problems. It's a never-ending puzzle that I am passionately engaged in solving. 

While I was learning to code in my spare time, I decided to join Le Wagon Melbourne for a Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp. It has taught me the technical skills, as wel as gaining a greater understanding of the user-oriented experience. 

Looking for an opportunity in software development. My technical skills include JavaScript, Ruby, Rails, HTML, CSS, Sass, jQuery, Bootstrap, ActiveRecord, PostgreSQL, Heroku, and Git. Alongside my technical skills I like to think open-minded and enjoy an open and honest way of collaborating within a team. I am able to adapt quickly and I'm excited to continuously learn and grow.

I am mostly spending my time building projects while diving deeper into the above mentioned technologies. 

My aspiration is to be part of developing software that improves and keeps up with the world.
